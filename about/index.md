hi!

I’m currently a rising senior at Scripps College majoring in computer science and minoring in math. However, I am majoring at Harvey Mudd College because Scripps doesn't have a computer science program and both schools are a part of the Claremont University Consortium. I completed the introductory sequence for computer science, learning Python, Java, C, C++, CSS, and HTML. I have also taken courses on data structures, programming development, discrete math, software verification, computer systems, software development, and algorithms.

I just finished working on a group project developing a web app that identifies flowers. We learned about neural networks and training models to classify images in one of our courses and decided to apply our knowledge. Our application identifies the flower species and tells the user how they can plant and care for it. Although we faced many obstacles and errors, we were able to overcome them through problem solving, self-teaching, and helping each other.

This past summer I worked for Girls Who Code for their Summer Immersion Program. This was a seven-week program that introduced high school girls to computer science. The girls came in with a range of abilities, some not know what programming or computer science was and some having some experience in Python or Java. I really enjoyed this experience because I was able to cater to each of the girl’s needs and encourage them to pursue computer science. Girls Who Code’s mission is to close the gender gap in the tech industry and I felt that I was able to foster a supportive and safe environment where they felt comfortable explore computer science.
